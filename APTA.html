            <h1 class="project-title">APTA: Redesigning Online Tutoring Systems </h1>
            <p>APTA (Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant) is a peer tutoring system that allows students to work collaboratively on math problems. This platform facilitates a tutor-tutee relationship between students and assists peer tutors on how to give better advice. In light of COVID-19, I was working with Katrina Yu to research how APTA could be adapted to an online learning environment.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Research Question: How can APTA be adapted to remote learning? </span></p>
            <br>
            <p>Students require immediate feedback. This need is exacerbated in an online learning environment because there are  <span style="font-weight: 600">no longer social cues that indicate a presence </span>on the other side of the interface. With the majority of learning now remote, it’s important to transfer as many aspects of a classroom context as possible in order to create a consistent learning experience for students and a seamless transition to remote learning.</p>

            <h3>PROCESS OVERVIEW</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section-text">
            <p>With such a vague goal of adapting APTA to an online learning environment, we followed a double diamond design process in order to narrow down the scope of our project. A LOT of time was spent within the first diamond - familiarizing ourselves with literature and bouncing ideas off other researchers in the lab. There were a lot of different directions this project could head in.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="project-section-text">
            <p style="margin-top:3em">After defining our project, we realized after reviewing insights from a pilot study done in March that many of the issues the children found then were similar to what we were finding now. It was clear that the poor UI along with the flawed user flow would prevent us from understanding other issues with the interface if not addressed first. At this point, we decided to shift gears. Many problems we found dealt with ideas of social translucence and promoting continuous conversation, so we were able to incorporate ideas from our initial research. </p>

            <p>Our work expands on what’s already been done on social translucence but specifically for remote learning. To promote this and continuous student engagement, we redesigned different features of the interface.</p>

            <h4 class = "project-section-subtitle">Chat</h4>
            <p>One of the first things we wanted to tackle was the chat feature. Since chats are used ubiquitously on many collaborative/social platforms, there is a greater expectation for the chat to perform as expected. In this way, we wanted to make it as intuitive as possible. We also added features to help students establish more of a social presence and promote continuous conversation. </p>

            <h4 class = "project-section-subtitle">Errors</h4>
            <p>We decided to change the flow of the tutor/tutee interaction. Before, the tutee was limited to inputting one step at a time (e.g. waiting for the tutor to grade every step before they could move on). However, it is not likely that a student will need help on every single step so this procedure creates a lot of ‘waiting time’. We want to decrease this by allowing the tutee to move at their own pace, while the tutor lags behind grading at their own pace. This change forced us to think about what would happen if the tutee inputs an incorrect step:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How would they be informed of their mistake?</li>
                <li>How would they be able to correct it?</li>

            <h4 class = "project-section-subtitle">Redesign Idea: Sketchpad</h4>
            <p>From our teacher interviews, we gathered that the way in which students and teachers explain math is very different from what could be reproduced with a chat. One teacher explained that she uses a lot of annotations (e.g. circling, underlining, arrows) when explaining complex ideas. This is lost when working in a remote learning environment. We played around with this idea:</p>

        <div class="project-section-text">
            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Research Question: How can we design APTA to support productive tutoring?</span></p>
            <br>
            <p>Students tutors don't give productive explanations/hints to their tutees.Through user testing our wireframes and observing students in the pilot testing of our initial version of APTA, we've noticed that students immediately resort to explicit instruction rather than conceptual explanations when asked for help. Some more specific questions we wanted to answer: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is it feasible to have students be graded by ‘step’? What would you consider a ‘step’ in a math problem? </li>
                <li>How can we encourage students to give more conceptual explanations rather than just giving the answer or specific steps? </li>
                <li>How would you integrade scaffolding for more productive hint-giving?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section-text">
            <h4 class = "project-section-subtitle">Interview Insights</h4>
            <p>The flexibility of the sketchpad allows for incorrect approaches to solving the problem. From the three middle schoolers we interviewed, we noticed that they all utilized a 'guess and check' approach where they would guess the answer and plug it in to check if it was the correct answer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This could be attributed to the flexibility of the sketchpad which allows for incorrect approaches to solving the problem. How can we adapt the sketchpad to encourage solving the problem step by step?</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Sometimes no direction is the best direction.</span> It’s okay to not know where you’re headed! Katrina and I spent weeks trying to narrow down the scope of our project and we sometimes felt like we weren’t accomplishing anything because there was nothing tangible to show for our efforts. However, we were researching, gathering data and insights, and eliminating ideas that were not effective. By the end, we really learned how to take comfort in the unknown - at the end of the day, that’s what research is all about!</p>
            <br>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Familiarity is your enemy. </span>There are so many little details that end up being very significant that you gloss over because you know your project so well. With these long-term projects it’s even more important to get feedback - either from users or even just another pair of eyes from someone you’re working with.
