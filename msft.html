            <h1 class="project-title">Microsoft Internship: Enterprise Search</h1>
            <p>This summer, I had the opportunity to complete a 3 month remote internship at Microsoft as a design intern on the Web Experience Collective Design and Research Team. With the goal of pushing Microsoft Search in Bing in the direction of a more modern enterprise search product, I thought about and designed a new feature for this product. </p>
            <br>

            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Parts of the work I've done have already been used in a recent design sprint with the larger team. </span> My work is inpiring other teams within enterprise and generating conversations about how to re-envision certain aspects of their products. This was a large scale project that included short and long term plans. </p>
            <br>

            <p>Although the internship was remote, I still went to check out seattle... highlights shown below :-) </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.bing.com/business/explore">Microsoft search in Bing</a> combines web and work search into a single experience. Employees can easily search for people, files, events, conversations, and internal sites within their organization - <span style="font-weight: 600">basically an internal search for companies. </span></p>

        <div class="project-section-text">
            <h4 class = "project-section-subtitle">Designing in a complex space</h4>
            <p>Not only was my project itself challenging because it was such an ambiguous space with not much user research don on it, I was also designing for a rather complex product. While designing in the enterprise space, <span style="font-weight: 600">I had to consider 2 separate end users and 3 different customer touchpoints. </span></p>
        </div>


        <div class="project-section-text">
            <h4 class = "project-section-subtitle">Designing a new feature</h4>
            <p>At a high level, this project was very exploratory in nature. The goal of my project was really to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore this new space</li>
                <li>Inspire</li>
                <li>Display a vision of what a modern enterprise product could be</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section-img">
            <img src="images2/msft_process.png">
        </div>
        <div class="project-section-text">
            <p>Because of the complexity of the enterprise space and of the project itself, the research stage was very important to navigating the project effectively. In order to understand the space and validate the problem, I talked directly to domain experts and end users. I outlined research questions for them, prepared mock-ups, and evaluated their feedback to find insights. Having done all this research, I was able to establish good design principles. I identified user needs, goals, and considerations that helped guide me as I move forward with my project. </p>
            <br>

            <p>In addition to prioritizing features and finding impact within the current system, I was able to expand and converge on my design explorations in order to land on a clear direction for my project. In my explorations, I wanted to find a good balance between creating a framework that worked well within the existing design system and breaking the current system entirely. Ideating as many different concepts as I could come up with, I identified 3 different frameworks I could potentially move forward with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subtle and well integrated in the system</li>
                <li>Separate from the system</li>
                <li>Expands on the system with a focus on differentiation</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>I ended up proposing a <span style="font-weight: 600">2-part recommendation</span> for this new feature, exploring both short and long term plans. I thought it was really cool that I was able to work on both sides of this spectrum!</p>

        <div class="project-section-right-text">
            <h5 class="gray-right-text">01 'Up Next' framework (short term) - easy to implement in the current design system</h5>
            <br>
            <h5 class="gray-right-text">02 'Tomorrow' framework (long term) - illustrates the optimal user experience beyond current limitations; more visionary</h5>

        </div>
        <div class="project-section-text">
            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Ask for help.</span> There were many points in my project where I didn't know how to proceed or didn't know how to make certain decisions. If I didn't reach out to my mentor, I would have just been stuck there. Instead, I realized that talking through my problems helped me think through the problem and a lot of the time that would help me make decisions that pushed my project forward.</p>
            <br>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Get comfortable with ambiguity.</span> When I first started, I really wanted to impress my team by doing everything right the first time aroun din order to prove that I was valuable to the team. Because of this I was scared to just explore just in case it was the completely wrong direction. I learned that that's really not the point of design. I needed to do those explorations to figure out what worked and what didn't. What I learned is that whether something works or not, it's necessary to try in order to move forward (applies to life as well :-)) </p>
            <br>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Speak up!</span> At the beginning of the internship, I would let my mentor take over in meetings because I felt that she could summarize our project in a more elegant and concise way than I could, and I would be scared of wasting people's time if I was not as good at presenting information. For this same reason, I also didn't push myself to contribute as much as I could have in calls because I assumed everything I could think of would have already been thought of. At the core of it, I simply didn't think I had much to offer because I was the most inexperienced person there. My biggest takeaway from this internship is that I have no reason to feel insecure that I don't know as much as those around me. In fact, i'm in such a privileged position to be the most inexperienced because that just means I have the most room to improve. Additionally, I'm able to offer my team a fresh perspective on everything because I haven't been working on our products as long as they have. Growth mindset is a really big part of Microsoft's culture and I definitely felt that this summer. I was pushed to put myself out there, make mistakes, and ge excited to learn and grow in new ways. In the future, I'm going to speak up when I have something to say - even if it's wrong or small or potentially misguided - because the worst that can happen is I learn from it. </p>
